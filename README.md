- So that I do not re-write this engine for a SIXTH time.
  - No more trying to abstract shit away and make it
    oh so fancy to use. This takes up too much
    time, and I am not a tools engineer at epic I need to bring
    down scope if I want to finish this in time.
- To facilitate future expandability, follow seperation of concerins
  but keep structs verbose so I can make some type of JSON or other
  config loader.
- FINISH THE DAMN THING!!!
